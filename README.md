## french vanilla
Le cadre l√©ger qui fonctionne avec n'importe quel langage de programmation. Based on vanilla, the lightweight framework that works with any programming language.

# Installation

Nothing, we are so advanced we are already bundled in your programming language of choice.

# Startup

Start up is so simple just put this comment at the top of the source file of your choice!

```\\ Vanille.startUp()```

Depening on your programming language comment style!

For bash, python:
```# Vanille.startUp()```

# Recognition

We also would really appreciate it if you gave us a quick comment plug above your Vanilla startUp command:
```
\\ Vanille - github.com/dhx-dennis/vanilla
\\ Vanille.startUp()
```

Feel free to use Vanilla with any other existing frameworks. We won't mind! The more the merrier.
